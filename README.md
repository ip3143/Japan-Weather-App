# Japan Weather App

Never looked at the weather forecast more than when I was in Japan since I was always out and about. Along with the weather forecast for the different cities in Japan, I also describe and illustrate my experience in the cities I've been to with lots of photos.

Used React JS and the OpenWeather API.
